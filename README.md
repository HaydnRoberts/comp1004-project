# comp1004-project
This is the repo for my plymouth uni comp1004 project

Please go to the Public folder to see the code I have written
output and input.css are made using tailwind, the rest is entirely written by me

I accidentally put the whole of node nodues in here, I acctually dont know how I did that but it is why it looks like there are thousands of files in the repository.

Thank you for looking at this project.
